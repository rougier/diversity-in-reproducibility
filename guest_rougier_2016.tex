%Recap of previous 

In our previous contribution, we proposed computational modelling-related definitions for \textbf{replicable}, experiments within a model can be recreated using its original codebase, and \textbf{reproducible}, a model can be recreated based on its specification. We stressed the importance of specifications and of access to codebases. Furthermore, we highlighted an issue in scholarly communication --- many journals do not require nor facilitate the sharing of code. In contrast, many third-party services have filled the gaps left by traditional publishers \cite<e.g.,>{binder, github, osf, rescience}. Notwithstanding, journals and peers rarely request or expect use of such services. We ended by asking: are we ready to associate codebases with articles and are we prepared to ensure computational theories are well-specified and coherently implemented?
